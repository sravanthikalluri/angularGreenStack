TriNet also advised you that, if you did not make an election to participate in a health care or dependent day care FSA for the new plan year, you would not be able to participate in such an account, as this type of election does not roll over to the new plan year.

If the cost of a plan from your employer that would cover you (and not any other members of your family) is more than 9.5% of your household income for the year, or if the coverage your employer provides does not meet the \"minimum value\" standard set by the Affordable Care Act, you may be eligible for a tax credit.1",

However, the premium rates for the new TriNet plan year would apply and such premiums would be deducted from your paychecks. TriNet further advised you that if you were automatically enrolled in similar plans because your exact, current elections no longer remained available for the new TriNet benefits plan year, such enrollment may have differences in coverage and networks, higher premiums, and higher out-of-pocket expenses than your current elections. TriNet also advised you that, if you did not make an election to participate in a health care or dependent day care FSA for the new plan year, you would not be able to participate in such an account, as this type of election does not roll over to the new plan year. You may add an HSA account at any time during the plan year if you are enrolled in an HDHP plan. However, your HSA election does not automatically roll over.
