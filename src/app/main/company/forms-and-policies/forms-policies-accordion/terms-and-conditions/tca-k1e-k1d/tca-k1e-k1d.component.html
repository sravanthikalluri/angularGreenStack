				<p>The TriNet family of companies is engaged in the business of providing human resources services through various licensed professional employer organizations (&quot;PEOs&quot;). In this TCA, &quot;TriNet&quot; includes TriNet Group, Inc., and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, whether doing business in their own name or otherwise.</p>
				<p>Your relationship with TriNet is beginning because the company for which you provide services (&quot;your worksite employer,&quot; or &quot;your company&quot;) is a TriNet customer. This means that your company has entered into an agreement with TriNet to allocate certain employer responsibilities between your company and TriNet as co-employers (not joint employers). TriNet will be your employer of record for administrative purposes and will sponsor and administer certain benefits, and provide certain human resources services. As your worksite employer, your company retains the responsibilities of directing your day-to-day services and managing its business affairs. Your worksite employer, not TriNet, has sole responsibility for providing input about your compensation, hours, and working conditions</p>
				<p>Your worksite employer has represented that it is either (1) a sole proprietor or an individually-owned single-member limited liability company with net earnings from employment reported on a Schedule C to IRS Form 1040 permanently residing and actively performing services in the U.S. or (2) a partnership or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, each partner or member, as applicable, of the worksite employer is either a partner or member, as applicable, under the terms and provisions of the worksite employer's partnership or operating agreement and the applicable state laws governing the worksite employer's organization, each partner or member, as applicable, is treated as a partner of the worksite employer and is thus &quot;self-employed&quot; for federal income tax and federal self-employment tax purposes, each partner or member, as applicable, is actively performing services on the worksite employer's behalf and such services are being performed in the U.S., no partner or member, as applicable, is permanently residing outside of the U.S. and no partner or member, as applicable, is a passive investor or retiree.  You hereby acknowledge that you are receiving compensation for the services you provide to the worksite employer in the form of net earnings from employment reported on a Schedule C to IRS Form 1040 (&quot;Schedule C Net Earnings&quot;) or distributions from your worksite employer that are reported by the worksite employer on a Schedule K-1 to IRS Form 1041 (a &quot;K-1&quot;). Accordingly, you acknowledge that TriNet is not permitted to pay you wages that are reported on an IRS Form W-2, and therefore TriNet is not responsible for processing your compensation or reporting your compensation on an IRS Form W-2.</p>

				<p>The personal information you provide online through the TriNet platform is used to facilitate your online HR or other transactions and to enable TriNet to act as your employer of record for certain administrative purposes and to provide the HR-related services your company has engaged TriNet to provide. You agree not to share with or disclose to anyone else your TriNet Employee ID or password for the TriNet platform. TriNet, in turn, agrees to use your information only as stated above, which may include sharing the information between platforms owned or licensed by the TriNet family of companies. TriNet will not provide your individually identifiable information to third-party providers or other commercial parties for commercial use except as permitted by you or as required by law.</p>
				<p>You agree that all information submitted by you to TriNet for employment, payroll and benefits administration purposes is and will be true and correct, and you understand that any misrepresentation may affect both your relationship with TriNet, your employment status with your worksite employer, as well as certain insurance or benefits provided to you. You authorize TriNet to enroll you in TriNet sponsored employee benefits, if you are an eligible employee under the terms of the plans, and to make changes to your benefits, payroll, and personal information according to the information you submit to TriNet directly or indirectly. Moreover, you agree to provide to TriNet a functioning email address for you, and to review and accept notices and forms sent to that email address as well as to review and accept notices and forms posted on the TriNet platform. When requested to do so you agree that you will cooperate with all the requests or instructions that we send to you at the email address provided by you or on your behalf.</p>
				<p>With respect to COBRA notices, IRS Forms 1095-C and any other notice or form for which consent to electronic delivery is required by law, you hereby agree and consent to electronic delivery by email or via such other method as permitted by law. Further, you agree to make such documents available to your spouse, domestic partner, and/or dependents, as applicable. Such documents will also be posted and made available on the TriNet platform. If you desire a paper copy of such documents, please contact the TriNet. Contact information is posted online on the TriNet platform.</p>
				<p>If you do not wish to receive such documents by electronic delivery, or if you withdraw your consent to electronic delivery, you will receive your COBRA notice or other such mandatory documents in hard copy form at no charge.</p>

			<div class="standard-padding" ng-if=" item.id === 3 && item.isOpen">
				<p>You understand, acknowledge and agree that:</p>
				<p>(a) While TriNet is responsible for processing wages for worksite employees of your company and is responsible to report those wages on IRS Form W-2, because you are receiving compensation for the services you provide to the company in the form of Schedule C Net Earnings or distributions from the company that are reported on a K-1, TriNet is not responsible for processing your compensation or reporting your compensation on an IRS Form W-2.  This accommodation will be addressed again in the future if the IRS or other applicable governmental entity or court definitively rules that recipients of Schedule C Net Earnings or K-1 distributions from a worksite employer may be paid wages that are reported on an IRS Form W-2 by a PEO that is already processing such payments for other employees of the same worksite employer.</p>
				<p>(b)	You represent that you receive distributions and/or other non-cash compensation from your company in excess of Federal and State wage and hour requirements, over which TriNet has no control, and you agree to hold TriNet harmless from any and all liability that may arise from this and waive any and all wage and hour claims against TriNet, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
				<p>(c)	Responsibility for compliance with accurate reporting of hours worked, legally required break periods, overtime, certain time off accrued and taken, and related matters are the responsibility of your company, over which TriNet has no control.  Moreover, TriNet does not determine or provide input about your rate of pay, the hours you are scheduled to work or actually work, any legally required break periods, or your exempt/non-exempt status under the law;</p>
				<p>(d) You represent that the services you provide for your worksite employer include a minimum of 30 hours of service per week for purposes of any employee benefits eligibility requirements.</p></li>
					<p>(e) You understand and acknowledge that the IRS does not allow you to pay employee benefit plan premiums on a pre-tax basis or to participate in the TriNet health care or dependent day care flexible spending accounts (&quot;FSAs&quot;). Your eligibility for participation in any other TriNet employee benefit plan will depend on the eligibility requirements of each plan. Further, you understand and acknowledge that certain TriNet-sponsored employee benefit plans are based on the level of cash compensation you receive and that you may not be eligible to participate in those benefit plans. You further understand and acknowledge that employees who have ownership interests in their companies, and who do not receive wages, are generally exempt from workers' compensation coverage and that workers' compensation insurance coverage will not be available to you due to the absence of reportable wages on an IRS Form W-2. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby waive any and all claims against TriNet for such compensation-based benefits, including, without limitation, all claims, losses, liabilities, obligations, and/or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorney's fees) arising from, relating to, or in connection with, in whole or in part, any workers' compensation claims and/or claims related to workplace injuries in respect of or asserted by you and you acknowledge that you will cause your company not to assert a defense of workers' compensation immunity against any related indemnity claim TriNet may make against your company;</p>
					<p>(f) 	You represent that you are eligible to work in the United States and you agree to submit a complete and accurate Form I-9 as a prerequisite to becoming a worksite employee of TriNet and being covered by the PEO services agreement between your company and TriNet.  As a worksite employee of TriNet, you accept the provisions of the TriNet Employee Handbook and the coverage under TriNet's Employment Practices Liability Insurance (&quot;EPLI&quot;);</p>
					<p>(g) 	TriNet's responsibility for payments to you is further limited in the following ways:</p>
				<ul class="list-style-none">
					<li>(i) Any payment TriNet makes to you will be considered a draw, advance or distribution, will be a pass-through payment as instructed by your company and will not be reported by TriNet as payment of wages on IRS Form W-2.  For any draw or advance to you that TriNet agrees to process for a fee for your company, TriNet will not apply any withholding or deductions. TriNet will pass through and make such payment in the amount specified and funded by your company. You and your company will be responsible for reporting any draw, advance or distribution to the IRS and other applicable tax authorities. Any dispute you have with respect to the payment or nonpayment of any such draw, advance or distribution will be a dispute between you and your company and you agree not to raise any such claim against TriNet and to hold TriNet harmless with respect to the same;</li>
					<li>(ii) If TriNet learns that it paid you an amount not authorized by your company, you agree to repay the amount to TriNet and you consent to TriNet reversing such payment, to the full extent permitted by law;</li>
					<li>(iii) If you believe that your company owes you more than what TriNet remits to you pursuant to your company's instructions (including payment for time that you have worked, or for commissions and bonuses, time that you have taken or accrued as sick/vacation leave/paid time off, time for any other paid leave of absence or amounts in excess of minimum wage), this will be the sole liability of your worksite employer, and your recourse for collection of such unpaid amounts is against your company and not TriNet; and</li>
					<li>(iv) Your worksite employer is solely responsible for reimbursement of any business expenses you may incur.</li>

				<p>You will be offered certain TriNet employee benefits if such benefits are offered to other employees of your worksite employer, subject to the terms of the benefit plan documents. You acknowledge and agree that if you elect to participate in a TriNet-sponsored employee benefit plan, you must abide by the rules set forth under the applicable plan document. Unless otherwise required by law, you acknowledge and agree that if you are eligible to elect TriNet benefits, but fail to submit a benefits election within the required deadline/timeframe, TriNet will implement benefit plan default elections and/or waivers automatically in accordance with the terms and provisions of the applicable TriNet benefit plans. Please refer to the applicable TriNet Benefits Guidebook and Summary Plan Description (SPD) for important details regarding the consequences of failing to make a timely election or waiver of coverage.</p>
				<p>You understand that you have access to an electronic copy of the Benefits Guidebook and SPD posted on the TriNet platform, as well as in PDF format that TriNet can email to you upon request, and as a hardcopy that TriNet can mail to you upon request. You agree to read the Benefits Guidebook and SPD carefully as it contains important information regarding TriNet's health and welfare plans.</p>
				<p>You understand that, if your company arranges to sponsor a different health plan, you may not be eligible to participate in a health plan sponsored by TriNet. </p>
				<p>Finally, you understand and agree that certain information about your TriNet benefits enrollment, including but not limited to plan elections, may be shared with your worksite employer for the purpose of verifying billing accuracy and/or for any other lawful purpose if and when your worksite employer ceases to do business with TriNet.</p>

				<p class="header-fontsize">a. How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>Subject to the limitations in subsection (b), this DRP covers any dispute arising out of or relating to your employment with TriNet and/or your company, as well as any related dispute with an employee, officer, or director of TriNet or your company (all of whom, in addition to TriNet customers, are intended to be beneficiaries of this DRP) (&quot;covered dispute&quot;). The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this DRP. Also, any applicable internal procedures for resolving disputes (e.g., procedures in the TriNet Employee Handbook for complaining about, and addressing complaints about, misconduct), as well as the option of mediation, will continue to apply with the goal being to resolve disputes before they are arbitrated. This DRP will survive termination of the employment relationship. With only the exceptions described below, arbitration will replace going before a court for a judge or jury trial, and even in the situations described below, NO JURY TRIAL WILL BE PERMITTED, unless applicable law does not allow enforcement of a pre-dispute jury trial waiver in the particular circumstances presented.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">b. Limitations On How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>The mandatory arbitration requirement of this DRP does not apply to claims that are eligible to be brought for workers' compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance benefits, nor does it apply to claims against a federal contractor if such claims are not subject to pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements, nor to claims properly made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution procedure if you are represented by a union and the dispute resolution procedure in the collective bargaining agreement conflicts with this DRP. The mandatory arbitration requirement does not prevent a party from bringing complaints, claims or charges before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program, and does not prevent a party from bringing claims in any forum as provided in Public Laws 111-203, 111-118 &amp; 112-10. Further, claims may be brought before any other administrative agency, provided applicable law does not preclude the right to bring claims there when there is a mandatory arbitration agreement.</p>
				<p>If at the time of a covered dispute there is an agreement between you and your company governing the resolution of the covered dispute, then to the extent inconsistent with this DRP, that agreement will be controlling as between you and your company (and its employees, officers and agents). The applicability of this DRP to covered disputes between you and TriNet (and its employees, officers and agents) will be unaffected by the existence of an agreement between you and your company regarding dispute resolution.</p>
				<p>This DRP does not excuse a requirement that a party exhaust administrative remedies before initiating the DRP to resolve a covered dispute.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">c. Starting Arbitration</p>
				<p>Before commencement of arbitration, the parties may, upon express written agreement of the parties, submit the dispute to mediation on terms and conditions agreeable to all parties. This DRP does not require mediation before commencing arbitration.</p>
				<p class="inline">
					Arbitration begins by bringing a claim under the applicable employment arbitration rules and procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) or any other dispute resolution provider agreed to by the parties, as then in effect and as modified by any superseding provisions in this DRP. JAMS' Employment Arbitration Rules may be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" class="tn-anchor  inline" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by using an internet search engine to locate the &quot;JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules.&quot; All claims in arbitration must be raised within the same time limits (statutes of limitation) that would apply in court. The arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of the parties and will be an experienced attorney licensed in the state where the arbitration will be held or retired judicial officer who served in that state as a judge or another qualified individual. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the applicable JAMS (or, if agreed to by the parties, another dispute resolution provider's) rules will apply to appoint an arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted no more than 75 miles from the location where you last regularly worked for your worksite employer, unless the parties agree to another location.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">d. How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted</p>
				<p>In arbitration, the parties will have the right to file motions challenging the pleadings (e.g. demurrer or motion to dismiss), conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions (e.g. summary judgment/adjudication), and present witnesses and evidence to present their cases and defenses. The specific provisions of this DRP and the applicable rules of JAMS (or any other dispute resolution provider agreed to by the parties) will direct the arbitrator in decisions regarding conducting the arbitration. To the extent any applicable arbitration rules are inconsistent with the terms of this DRP, the terms of this DRP will be controlling.</p>
				<p>
					<b>
						There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative or private attorney general action, or as a member in any purported class, collective, representative or private attorney general proceeding, including, without limitation, uncertified class actions (&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;); provided, however, that you may opt out of the Class Action Waiver by clicking/checking this box
						<input type="checkbox" disabled ng-model="$ctrl.data.clientActWaiver" aria-label="Class Action Waiver" ng-true-value="'Y'" ng-false-value="'N'"/>
						before you acknowledge this TCA.
					</b>Disputes regarding the validity and enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, representative, and/or private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. No employee will be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline for exercising his or her rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action, but TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer or employee(s) of either TriNet or a TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its/their own benefit) retains the right to enforce this DRP and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and to seek dismissal of class, collective or representative actions.
				</p>
				<p>During the arbitration each party will pay his, her, or its own attorneys' fees, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases where the law requires it, TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer or employee(s) of either TriNet or a TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its/their own benefit) will pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees. In cases in which apportionment of the arbitrator's and arbitration fees is permitted by applicable law, these fees will be divided between the parties as is required by law and determined by the arbitrator.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">e. The Arbitration Hearing And Award</p>
				<p>Within 30 days after the end of the arbitration hearing, any party may file a written brief by providing copies to the arbitrator and the other parties. The arbitrator may award any remedy warranted under applicable law and will include a written opinion providing reasoned explanations for the decision. To the extent, if at all, allowed or required by applicable law, the award may be confirmed, corrected, or vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction, and a court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter judgment based on a final arbitration award.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">f. Enforcement Of The DRP</p>
				<p>Subject to the exceptions provided herein, this DRP is the full and complete agreement for resolution of covered disputes. If any portion of this DRP is determined to be unenforceable, the remainder of this DRP will still be enforceable, subject to the specific exception in section (d), above.
