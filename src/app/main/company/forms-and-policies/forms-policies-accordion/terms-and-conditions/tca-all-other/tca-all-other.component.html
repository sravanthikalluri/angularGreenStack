				<p class="header-fontsize">a. How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>
					This DRP covers any dispute arising out of or relating to your relationship with TriNet, including, without limitation, this TCA and your use of TriNet Passport&#174; and TriNet's online services. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this DRP. Also, existing internal procedures for resolving disputes, as well as the option of mediation, will continue to apply with the goal being to resolve disputes before they are arbitrated. This DRP will survive termination of the relationship. <b>With only the exceptions described below, arbitration will replace going before a government agency or a court for a judge or jury trial.</b>
				</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">b. Limitations On How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>Claims may be brought before an administrative agency if applicable law allows such claims even when there is an arbitration agreement. This DRP does not, however, excuse a requirement that a party exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. This DRP does not prevent a party from bringing complaints, claims or charges before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program and does not prevent a party from bringing claims in any forum as provided in Public Laws 111-203, 111-118 & 112-10. Nor does this DRP apply to any disputes that are, at the time of your acknowledgement of the DRP, already the subject of an existing lawsuit or agency proceeding.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">c. Starting Arbitration</p>
				<p>Before commencement of arbitration, the parties may, upon written agreement of the parties, submit the dispute to mediation. This DRP does not require mediation before commencing arbitration.</p>
				<p class="inline">
					Arbitration begins by bringing a claim under the applicable arbitration rules and procedures of either the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) or the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), as then in effect and as modified by any superseding provisions in this DRP.  The party bringing the claim may choose to bring the claim before either AAA or JAMS. The applicable Arbitration Rules may be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.adr.org" class="tn-anchor  inline" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> and <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" class="tn-anchor  inline" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by using an internet search engine to locate the &quot;AAA Arbitration Rules&quot; and &quot;JAMS Arbitration Rules.&quot;  All claims in arbitration must be raised within the same time limits (statutes of limitation) that would apply in court. The arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of the parties and will be an experienced attorney licensed in the state where the arbitration will be held or retired judicial officer who served in that state as a judge. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the applicable AAA or JAMS rules will apply to appoint an arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of TriNet's office closest to you.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">d. How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted</p>
				<p>In arbitration, the parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses. The specific provisions of this DRP and the applicable rules of AAA or JAMS will direct the arbitrator in decisions regarding the enforceability of this DRP and in conducting the arbitration.</p>
				<p>
					<b>
						There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative or private attorney general action, or as a member in any purported class, collective, representative or private attorney general proceeding, including, without limitation, uncertified class actions (&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;); provided, however, that you may opt out of the Class Action Waiver by clicking this box
						<input type="checkbox" disabled ng-model="$ctrl.data.clientActWaiver" aria-label="Class Action Waiver"  ng-true-value="'Y'" ng-false-value="'N'"/>
						before you click below to acknowledge this TCA.
					</b> Disputes regarding the validity and enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, representative or private attorney general action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, representative and/or private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. No employee will be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline for exercising his or her rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action, but TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its own benefit) retains the right to enforce this DRP and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and to seek dismissal of class, collective or representative actions.
				</p>
				<p>During the arbitration each party will pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases where the law requires it, TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its own benefit) will pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees. In cases in which apportionment of the arbitrator's and arbitration fees is permitted by applicable law, these fees will be divided between the parties as is required by law and determined by the arbitrator.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">e. The Arbitration Hearing And Award</p>
				<p>Within 30 days after the end of the arbitration hearing, any party may file a written brief by providing copies to the arbitrator and the other parties. The arbitrator may award any remedy warranted under applicable law and will include a written opinion providing reasoned explanations for the decision. Neither a party nor the arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of the arbitration without the prior written consent of all parties or in accordance with the arbitrator's decision that disclosure is permitted by law. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter a judgment upon the arbitration award. To the extent, if at all, allowed by applicable law, the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">f. Enforcement Of The DRP</p>
				<p>
					This DRP is the full and complete agreement relating to arbitration as the means to resolve covered disputes. If any portion of this DRP is determined to be unenforceable, the remainder of this DRP still will be enforceable, subject to the specific exception in section d, above. <b>With respect to covered disputes, each party waives any rights under the law for a jury trial and agrees to arbitration in accordance with the terms of this DRP.</b>
