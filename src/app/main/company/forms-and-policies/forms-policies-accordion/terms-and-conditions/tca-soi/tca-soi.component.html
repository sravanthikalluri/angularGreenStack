				<p>The TriNet family of companies is engaged in the business of providing human resources services through various licensed professional employer organizations (&quot;PEOs&quot;).  In this TCA, &quot;TriNet&quot; includes TriNet Group, Inc., and all its direct and indirect subsidiaries (including, but not limited to your TriNet co-employer, as defined below), whether doing business in their own name or otherwise. </p>
				<p>Your relationship with TriNet is beginning because the company you work for (&quot;your worksite employer,&quot; &quot;your company&quot; or &quot;my company&quot;) is a TriNet customer. This means that your company has entered into an agreement with a TriNet PEO company to share certain employer responsibilities as co-employers. This means that a TriNet PEO company (the company whose name appears on your wage statements, your &quot;TriNet co-employer&quot;) will be your employer of record for certain administrative purposes and will process payroll based on the information provided by your worksite employer, sponsor and administer benefits, and provide certain human resources services. As your worksite employer, your company retains the responsibilities of directing your day-to-day work and managing its business affairs.  Your worksite employer, not TriNet, has sole responsibility for controlling, or proving input about, your wages, hours, and working conditions.</p>


			</div>
			<div class="standard-padding" ng-if=" item.id === 2 && item.isOpen">
				<p>The personal information you provide online through the TriNet platform is used to facilitate your online HR and other transactions and to enable your TriNet co-employer to act as your employer of record for certain administrative purposes. You agree not to share with or disclose to anyone else your TriNet Employee ID or password for the TriNet platform. TriNet, in turn, agrees to use your information only as stated above. TriNet will not provide your individually identifiable information to third-party providers or other commercial parties for commercial use except as permitted by you or as required by law.</p>
				<p>You agree that all information submitted by you to TriNet for employment, payroll and benefits administration purposes is and will be true and correct to the best of your knowledge, and you understand that any misrepresentation may affect both your relationship with TriNet, employment status with your worksite employer, as well as certain insurance or benefits provided to you. You authorize TriNet to enroll you in TriNet sponsored employee benefits, if you are an eligible employee under the terms of the plans, and to make changes to your benefits, payroll, and personal information according to the information you submit to TriNet directly or indirectly. Moreover, you agree to provide to TriNet a functioning email address for you, and to review and accept notices and other documents sent to that email address as well as to review and accept notices and other documents posted on the TriNet platform.</p>
				<p>With respect to IRS Form W-2, COBRA notices, and any other notice or form for which consent to electronic delivery is required by law, you hereby agree and consent to electronic delivery by email or via such other method as permitted by law for the duration of your employment.  Such documents will also be posted and made available on the TriNet platform.  Further, you agree to make such documents available to your spouse, domestic partner, and/or dependents, as applicable. If you want to request paper copies of such documents in addition to the electronic version, please contact the TriNet Solution Center at 1.800.638.0461, at employees@trinet.com, or at 9000 Town Center Parkway, Bradenton, Florida 34202.  Such a request is not considered a withdrawal of your consent to receive such documents electronically and you will continue to do so.  After your employment with your worksite employer terminates, you will continue to have access to the platform and any Form W-2s issued to you by the worksite employer for the past four calendar years (for those years the worksite employer has been a TriNet customer).  The Form W-2 for the calendar year in which your employment terminates will also be posted to the platform when it's ready.</p>
				<p>If you want to withdraw your consent to electronic delivery, do so under the &quot;Settings&quot; link on the TriNet platform.  The withdrawal will be effective immediately, and you will receive an e-mail confirmation.  After your consent is withdrawn, you will receive your Form W-2, COBRA notice or other such mandatory documents in paper at no charge.  Any withdrawn consent does not apply to documents previously issued electronically.</p>
				<p>Further, you may be required to print and attach the Form W-2 to a federal, state, or local income tax return.  You can print or save a copy of your Form W-2 directly from the TriNet platform.  In addition, should you ever need to update your contact information, please do so on the TriNet platform.  TriNet will notify you of any changes to its contact information.</p>

						In the event your company fails to fund payroll, any requests for payment of wages should be made to your company; and

						<li>(iii)If you believe that your company owes you more than what TriNet remits to you (including payment for time that you have worked, or for commissions and bonuses,
						time that you have taken or accrued as sick/vacation leave/paid time off, time for any other paid leave of absence or amounts in excess of minimum wage), this will be the sole liability of your worksite employer,

				<p>You will be offered certain TriNet employee benefits if such benefits are offered to other similarly situated employees, subject to the terms of the benefits plan document. You acknowledge and agree that if you elect to participate in TriNet cafeteria plan and health and welfare benefits, you must abide by the rules set forth under the applicable plan document. Unless otherwise required by law, you acknowledge and agree that, if you are eligible to elect TriNet benefits but fail to submit a benefits election within the required deadline/timeframe, you must wait until the next open enrollment period to elect new coverage or make changes to your elections unless you experience a life status change event. Please refer to your applicable TriNet Benefits Guidebook and Summary Plan Description for important details regarding the consequences of failing to make a timely election or waiver of coverage.</p>
				<p>You understand that you have access to an electronic copy of your applicable TriNet Benefits Guidebook and Summary Plan Description posted on the TriNet platform, as well as in PDF format that TriNet can email to you upon request, and as a hardcopy that TriNet can mail to you upon request. You agree to read the Guidebook carefully as it contains important information regarding TriNet cafeteria plan and health and welfare benefits.</p>
				<p>You understand that, if your company arranges to sponsor a different health plan, you will not be eligible to participate in a health plan sponsored by TriNet. In such case, you also understand and agree that your company may request that TriNet take deductions from your pay for the healthcare premiums associated with your participation in the health plan sponsored by your company. You hereby consent to such deductions, and you understand and agree that they will appear on your pay stub as a deduction amount and will be reported accordingly on your Form W-2.</p>
				<p>You also understand and agree that certain information about your TriNet benefits enrollment, including but not limited to plan elections and the amounts of your salary deductions (including, if applicable, salary deferrals for a retirement plan, contributions to a health care flexible spending account, dependent day care flexible spending account, and similar arrangements), may be shared with your worksite employer, for the purpose of verifying billing accuracy and/or for any other lawful purpose if and when your worksite employer ceases to do business with TriNet.</p>

				<p class="header-fontsize">a. How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>Subject to the limitations in subsection (b), this DRP covers any dispute arising out of or relating to your co-employment with TriNet, including your TriNet co-employer, and/or arising out of or relating to your employment with your company, as well as any dispute with a benefit plan, insurer, employee, officer, or director of TriNet or of a TriNet customer (all of whom, in addition to TriNet customers, are intended to be beneficiaries of this DRP) (&quot;covered dispute&quot;). The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this DRP. Also, any applicable internal procedures for resolving disputes (e.g., procedures in the employee handbook for complaining about, and addressing complaints about, misconduct), as well as the option of mediation, will continue to apply with the goal being to resolve disputes before they are arbitrated. This DRP will survive termination of the employment relationship. With only the exceptions described below, arbitration will replace going before a court for a judge or jury trial, and even in the situations described below, NO JURY TRIAL WILL BE PERMITTED, unless applicable law does not allow enforcement of a pre-dispute jury trial waiver in the particular circumstances presented.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">b. Limitations On How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>The mandatory arbitration requirement of this DRP does not apply to claims for workers' compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance benefits, nor does it apply to claims against a federal contractor if such claims are not subject to pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements, nor to claims properly made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution procedure if you are represented by a union and the dispute resolution procedure in the collective bargaining agreement conflicts with this DRP. The mandatory arbitration requirement does not prevent a party from bringing complaints, claims or charges before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program, and does not prevent a party from bringing claims in any forum as provided in Public Laws 111-203, 111-118 &amp; 112-10. Further, claims may be brought before any other administrative agency, provided applicable law does not preclude the right to bring claims there when there is a mandatory arbitration agreement.</p>
				<p>If at the time of a covered dispute there is an agreement between you and your company governing the resolution of the covered dispute, then to the extent inconsistent with this DRP, that agreement will be controlling as between you and your company (and its employees, officers, and agents). The applicability of this DRP to covered disputes between you and TriNet (and its employees, officers and, agents) will be unaffected by the existence of an agreement between you and your company regarding dispute resolution.</p>
				<p>This DRP does not excuse a requirement that a party exhaust administrative remedies before initiating the DRP to resolve a covered dispute.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">c. Starting Arbitration</p>
				<p>Before commencement of arbitration, the parties may, upon express written agreement of the parties, submit the dispute to mediation on terms and conditions agreeable to all parties. This DRP does not require mediation before commencing arbitration.</p>
				<p class="inline">Arbitration begins by bringing a claim under the applicable employment arbitration rules and procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) or any other dispute resolution provider agreed to by the parties, as then in effect and as modified by any superseding provisions in this DRP. JAMS' Employment Arbitration Rules may be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" class="tn-anchor  inline" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by using an internet search engine to locate the &quot;JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules.&quot; All claims in arbitration must be raised within the same time limits (statutes of limitation) that would apply in court. The arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of the parties and will be an experienced attorney licensed in the state where the arbitration will be held or retired judicial officer who served in that state as a judge or another qualified individual. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the applicable JAMS (or, if agreed to by the parties, another dispute resolution provider's) rules will apply to appoint an arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted no more than 75 miles from the location where you last regularly worked for your worksite employer, unless the parties agree to another location.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">d. How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted</p>
				<p>In arbitration, the parties will have the right to file motions challenging the pleadings (e.g. demurrer or motion to dismiss), conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions (e.g. summary judgment/adjudication), and present witnesses and evidence to present their cases and defenses. The specific provisions of this DRP and the applicable rules of JAMS (or any other dispute resolution provider agreed to by the parties) will direct the arbitrator in decisions regarding conducting the arbitration. To the extent any applicable arbitration rules are inconsistent with the terms of this DRP, the terms of this DRP will be controlling.</p>
				<p>
					<b>
						There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, or as a member in any purported class, collective, representative, or private attorney general proceeding, including, without limitation, uncertified class actions (&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;); provided, however, that you may opt out of the Class Action Waiver by clicking this box
						<input type="checkbox" disabled ng-model="$ctrl.data.clientActWaiver" aria-label="Class Action Waiver" ng-true-value="'Y'" ng-false-value="'N'"/>
						before you click below to acknowledge this TCA.
					</b> Disputes regarding the validity and enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, representative, and/or private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. No employee will be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline for exercising his or her rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action, but TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer or employee(s) of either TriNet or a TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its/their own benefit) retains the right to enforce this DRP and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and to seek dismissal of class, collective or representative actions.
				</p>
				<p>During the arbitration, each party will pay his, her, or its own attorneys' fees, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases where the law requires it, TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer or employee(s) of either TriNet or a TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its/their own benefit) will pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees. In cases in which apportionment of the arbitrator's and arbitration fees is permitted by applicable law, these fees will be divided between the parties as is required by law and determined by the arbitrator.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">e. The Arbitration Hearing And Award</p>
				<p>Within 30 days after the end of the arbitration hearing, any party may file a written brief by providing copies to the arbitrator and the other parties. The arbitrator may award any remedy warranted under applicable law and will include a written opinion providing reasoned explanations for the decision. To the extent, if at all, allowed or required by applicable law, the award may be confirmed, corrected, or vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction, and a court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter judgment based on a final arbitration award.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">f. Enforcement Of The DRP</p>
				<p>Subject to the exceptions provided herein, this DRP is the full and complete agreement for resolution of covered disputes between you and TriNet (and its employees, officers, and agents) and between you and your company (and its employees, officers, and agents). If any portion of this DRP is determined to be unenforceable, the remainder of this DRP will still be enforceable, subject to the specific exception in section (d), above.</p>
