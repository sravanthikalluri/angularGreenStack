				<p class="header-fontsize">a. How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>Subject to the limitations in subsection (b), this DRP covers any dispute arising out of or relating to your interactions with TriNet, and/or arising out of or relating to your relationship with your company, as well as any dispute with an employee, officer, or director of TriNet or of a TriNet customer (all of whom, in addition to TriNet customers, are intended to be beneficiaries of this DRP) (&quot;covered dispute&quot;). The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this DRP. Also, any applicable internal procedures for resolving disputes (e.g., procedures in the employee handbook for complaining about, and addressing complaints about, misconduct), as well as the option of mediation, will continue to apply with the goal being to resolve disputes before they are arbitrated. <b>With only the exceptions described below, arbitration will replace going before a court for a judge or jury trial, and even in the situations described below, NO JURY TRIAL WILL BE PERMITTED, unless applicable law does not allow enforcement of a pre-dispute jury trial waiver in the particular circumstances presented.</b></p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">b. Limitations On How The DRP Applies</p>
				<p>The mandatory arbitration requirement of this DRP does not apply to claims for workers' compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance benefits, nor does it apply to claims against a federal contractor if such claims are not subject to pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements, nor to claims properly made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution procedure if you are represented by a union and the dispute resolution procedure in the collective bargaining agreement conflicts with this DRP. The mandatory arbitration requirement does not prevent a party from bringing complaints, claims or charges before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program, and does not prevent a party from bringing claims in any forum as provided in Public Laws 111-203, 111-118 &amp; 112-10. Further, claims may be brought before any other administrative agency, provided applicable law does not preclude the right to bring claims there when there is a mandatory arbitration agreement.</p>
				<p><b>If at the time of a covered dispute there is an agreement between you and your company governing the resolution of the covered dispute, then to the extent inconsistent with this DRP, that agreement will be controlling as between you and your company (and its employees, officers, and agents). The applicability of this DRP to covered disputes between you and TriNet (and its employees, officers, and agents) will be unaffected by the existence of an agreement between you and your company regarding dispute resolution.</b></p>
				<p>This DRP does not excuse a requirement that a party exhaust administrative remedies before initiating the DRP to resolve a covered dispute.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">c. Starting Arbitration</p>
				<p>Before commencement of arbitration, the parties may, upon express written agreement of the parties, submit the dispute to mediation on terms and conditions agreeable to all parties. This DRP does not require mediation before commencing arbitration.</p>
				<p>Arbitration begins by bringing a claim under the applicable employment arbitration rules and procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) or any other dispute resolution provider agreed to by the parties, as then in effect and as modified by any superseding provisions in this DRP. JAMS' Employment Arbitration Rules may be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by using an internet search engine to locate the &quot;JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules.&quot; All claims in arbitration must be raised within the same time limits (statutes of limitation) that would apply in court. The arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of the parties and will be an experienced attorney licensed in the state where the arbitration will be held or retired judicial officer who served in that state as a judge or another qualified individual. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the applicable JAMS (or, if agreed to by the parties, another dispute resolution provider's) rules will apply to appoint an arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted no more than 75 miles from the location where you last regularly worked for your worksite employer, unless the parties agree to another location.</p>
				<br/>

				<p class="header-fontsize">d. How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted</p>
				<p>In arbitration, the parties will have the right to file motions challenging the pleadings (e.g. demurrer or motion to dismiss), conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions (e.g. summary judgment/adjudication), and present witnesses and evidence to present their cases and defenses. The specific provisions of this DRP and the applicable rules of JAMS (or any other dispute resolution provider agreed to by the parties) will direct the arbitrator in decisions regarding conducting the arbitration. To the extent any applicable arbitration rules are inconsistent with the terms of this DRP, the terms of this DRP will be controlling.</p>
				<p>
					<b>
						There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative or private attorney general action, or as a member in any purported class, collective, representative or private attorney general proceeding, including, without limitation, uncertified class actions (&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;); provided, however, that you may opt out of the Class Action Waiver by clicking this box
						<input type="checkbox" name="CLS_ACT_WAIVR" disabled ng-model="$ctrl.data.clientActWaiver" aria-label="Class Action Waiver" ng-true-value="'Y'" ng-false-value="'N'" />
						before you click below to acknowledge this TCA.
					</b>Disputes regarding the validity and enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, representative, and/or private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. No employee will be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline for exercising his or her rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action, but TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer or employee(s) of either TriNet or a TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its/their own benefit) retains the right to enforce this DRP and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and to seek dismissal of class, collective or representative actions.
				</p>
				<p>During the arbitration, each party will pay his, her, or its own attorneys' fees, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases where the law requires it, TriNet (and, if applicable, any TriNet customer or employee(s) of either TriNet or a TriNet customer interested in enforcing this DRP for its/their own benefit) will pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees. In cases in which apportionment of the arbitrator's and arbitration fees is permitted by applicable law, these fees will be divided between the parties as is required by law and determined by the arbitrator.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">e. The Arbitration Hearing And Award</p>
				<p>Within 30 days after the end of the arbitration hearing, any party may file a written brief by providing copies to the arbitrator and the other parties. The arbitrator may award any remedy warranted under applicable law and will include a written opinion providing reasoned explanations for the decision. To the extent, if at all, allowed or required by applicable law, the award may be confirmed, corrected, or vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction, and a court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter judgment based on a final arbitration award.</p>
				<br />

				<p class="header-fontsize">f. Enforcement Of The DRP</p>
				<p>Subject to the exceptions provided herein, this DRP is the full and complete agreement for resolution of covered disputes between you and TriNet (and its employees, officers, and agents) and between you and your company (and its employees, officers, and agents). If any portion of this DRP is determined to be unenforceable, the remainder of this DRP will still be enforceable, subject to the specific exception in section (d), above.</p>
